                    <html><body><p>Mother of Five and I got to planting today. We got all of the Stratego series (a set of five) planted, and some of the Games Closet. I'll probably go back on Thursday and finish planting the Games. I have a couple more to carve any way.<br/>
<br/>For this gathering, I am opting for many stamp-only boxes, with logs in the last of the series. It takes such a long time when you have to stamp in at each box.<br/><br/>Weather was terrific; the trails were dry. BRING MOSQUITO SPRAY! The bugs are bad!<br/>
<br/>We hope to be where we were for the Oz Gathering. From Memorial Drive, turn into Picnic Loop, and go left through the two sets of gates. Follow the one-way loop back, always choosing to go right when given an option. When you get to the very back of the park, you should see a restroom on your left. Pull into the parking lot that is on the right, just past the swing set with two infant swings on it. There is a cluster of tables there in the back, with a small hill. If this location doesn't work out, we'll try for another one along the loop. I'll figure out something that will make it obvious where we are!<br/>
<br/>We're looking forward to it. Should be lots of fun to see you all!<br/><br/>Dewberry<br/><br/><br/>
