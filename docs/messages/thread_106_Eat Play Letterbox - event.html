The purpose of the event is to Meet (eat), Play (find letterboxes) and Letterbox (plant letterboxes).  It seems that there are so many letterboxes in Galveston that are missing (probably) that no one is sure what's there and what's not and, of those that are there, condition may be an issue because of the hurricanes.  So we'll meet and try to find or visit every letterbox listed on Atlas Quest and LbNA as being in Galveston, more properly, on the island.  When we get a good list of boxes that are actually missing, we'll notify the owner, if he or she is still active or, failing to find the owner, notify the moderators of AQ and LbNA and see if they will archive or retire the box listing.  It's a one-day event with a meet at a restaurant to be determined and another meeting later in the day to access the damage and make a report.  All are welcome.<br/>

I'm in...don't have soccer schedule yet so I don't know exactly what time we can get there.<br/>

We were in Galveston twice the last two weeks to drop off and pick up my oldest son at camp, but we didn't get a chance to letterbox at all.  <br/>
<br/>
Having hidden a box that lasted a good two years, there really is a dearth of decent spots in Galveston...probably not helped by the fact that the island lost 90% of its oak trees.  I'd like to suggest we all think creatively about containers (maybe magnetic ones) as we think about how to plant on the island.<br/>

I have a replacement for my pirate box so it would be great to have a reason to make sure I plant it.<br/>

I bought it at Walmart for about $6 but haven't actually put it out as a letterbox.  It's plenty strong, but has a small steel rod for the hinge, which I'm afraid might rust through.<br/>

One was a normal box in a small patch of woods and that was lost to a geocache that took over my hiding spot...so container didn't have much to do with it. The other was a mini box that was hidden in a palm tree. That one was eventually probably not wedged in right and fell down.<br/>
<br/>I think that bringing in rocks or heavy things to weight boxes down or attaching them is probably a good choice, or going small and maybe magnetic. There are just so few trees on lots of the island and people everywhere on busy summer days.<br/>
<br/>the Travelin' T's great storm box was beneath a historical marker and that was sheared off in Ike. There's not really much you can do about that--I think for a true hurricane we'll probably lose most if not all of the boxes.<br/>
