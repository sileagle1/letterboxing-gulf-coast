<br/>
It's so hard to get accurate numbers.  On AQ, you won't find most of<br/>
the baby bear &amp; and silver eagle boxes, but on LBNA all the missing<br/>
Hawk boxes are still listed as active.<br/>
<br/>
On AQ, I marked as retired those Hawk boxes that someone knew for a<br/>
fact were missing.    <br/>
<br/>
That's why I use both sites.  But if you're interested in a Hawk box,<br/>
I would definitely check AQ for that.  And if you know of a for-sure<br/>
missing Hawk box, let me know and I'll mark it as retired.<br/>

<div>I read once where 
someone said you go on vacation and come back saying, "Nice place to visit, but 
I wouldn't want to live there" but that the opposite is true of Houston.  
The city is so overwhelming in size that you really have to live here to have 
time to discover all its charms.  I love Houston, and now this is just 
another reason to make me happy I live here!  Come on down, Lucy!  
We'll show you around!  MO5  </div></body></html>
