<br/>
So, we get to spend a whole week in Houston (a town I love to LB!), but not for any fun reason. :/  Our 1 year old will be admitted to Texas Children's for a week starting Nov 23.  I am wondering if there are any boxes planted on the grounds of Tx C?  It would be a nice break from reality to take a short walk outside and find a box.  I know it's a long shot for there to be any there, but I thought I'd check.<br/>

Thanks,<br/>

Unfortunately, we're getting a little too practiced with Diana being in the hospital.  She has a genetic disorder called Alagille Syndrome.  It affects many body systems, but primarily the liver and heart.  She spent 4 days in the hospital last year right before Christmas for a liver biopsy and exploratory surgery.  then we spent 3 weeks in April for IV antibiotics for a liver infection called cholangitis.<br/>
<br/>
We've been seen twice already at TCH, but only as outpatients. they've done a full liver transplant evaluation on her, and are trying to wait for her to gain weight before they transplant.  She's only 14 pounds even though she's a year old.  It's pretty darn cute, in a lot of ways.  She's the size of a 3 or 4 month old, but walking!  When we go out, people tend to think I have a miracle baby--a walking 3 month old.  Well, I do.  Just not in the way they think!<br/>
<br/>
We should be released the Monday after T-giving, so I'll send you a quick update then.  Thanks for the info on TCH, it's always helpful to hear from another mom how their experience went.<br/>
<br/>
<br/>
All the best,<br/>
<br/>

PS- Here is the link to Diana's 1 year portraits-- I like to show off our talented photographer friend as much as I do our cutie pie.  :)<br/>

&gt; Thanks Dewberry.  I doubt we'll have the chance to go that far away.  <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Unfortunately, we're getting a little too practiced with Diana being in the hospital.  She has a genetic disorder called Alagille Syndrome.  It affects many body systems, but primarily the liver and heart.  She spent 4 days in the hospital last year right before Christmas for a liver biopsy and exploratory surgery.  then we spent 3 weeks in April for IV antibiotics for a liver infection called cholangitis.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We've been seen twice already at TCH, but only as outpatients. they've done a full liver transplant evaluation on her, and are trying to wait for her to gain weight before they transplant.  She's only 14 pounds even though she's a year old.  It's pretty darn cute, in a lot of ways.  She's the size of a 3 or 4 month old, but walking!  When we go out, people tend to think I have a miracle baby--a walking 3 month old.  Well, I do.  Just not in the way they think!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; We should be released the Monday after T-giving, so I'll send you a quick update then.  Thanks for the info on TCH, it's always helpful to hear from another mom how their experience went.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; All the best,<br/>

&gt; PS- Here is the link to Diana's 1 year portraits-- I like to show off our talented photographer friend as much as I do our cutie pie.  :)<br/>

&gt; &gt; Oh PlaneCake, sorry to hear that about your baby.  My son had emergency<br/>
&gt; &gt; surgery and spent a week in TCH when he was 19 months old.  The surgery<br/>
&gt; &gt; saved his life...and the doctors and nurses were extremely dedicated and<br/>
&gt; &gt; professional.  You'd never know he was so ill if you saw him today.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; There's one letterbox across the street at Rice (but it's in the library so<br/>
&gt; &gt; I'm not sure about hours) and there are a few at Hermann Park which is<br/>
&gt; &gt; nearby.  But there aren't any that I'm aware of in the actual medical<br/>
&gt; &gt; center.<br/>
&gt; &gt; <br/>
&gt; &gt; It's a very surreal experience when your child is in the hospital.  Please<br/>
&gt; &gt; let us know if we can help you in anyway and all the best.  Let us know how<br/>
&gt; &gt; it goes.<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks to everyone for your prayers!  Diana's hospital stay went well.  She now has a feeding tube, and it seems to be helping her gain weight.  We're just hoping to get her as bulky as possible in case she ends up needing to liver transplant.  She's 15 months old, and just hit 16 pounds!  So, she looks like a 5 month old that can walk!  We get a lot of strange looks when we're out and about. :)<br/>

Hope you all had a great holiday season and we can't wait to see everyone at the next event.<br/>

&gt; Our 4 year old grandson, Noah, was born with a defect in a heart valve and was in Texas Childrens Hospital when he was about 3 months old to correct the problem.  TCH is an incredible place, so you're going to be in the best hands possible.  Noah's a normal active four-year old boy now, so I know your baby will be fine as well.  Prayers and best wishes.<br/>
