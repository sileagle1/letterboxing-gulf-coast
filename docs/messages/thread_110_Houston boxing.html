                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi all,<br>
<br>
So, we get to spend a whole week in Houston (a town I love to LB!), but not for any fun reason. :/  Our 1 year old will be admitted to Texas Children's for a week starting Nov 23.  I am wondering if there are any boxes planted on the grounds of Tx C?  It would be a nice break from reality to take a short walk outside and find a box.  I know it's a long shot for there to be any there, but I thought I'd check.<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>

Unfortunately, we're getting a little too practiced with Diana being in the hospital.  She has a genetic disorder called Alagille Syndrome.  It affects many body systems, but primarily the liver and heart.  She spent 4 days in the hospital last year right before Christmas for a liver biopsy and exploratory surgery.  then we spent 3 weeks in April for IV antibiotics for a liver infection called cholangitis.<br>
<br>
We've been seen twice already at TCH, but only as outpatients. they've done a full liver transplant evaluation on her, and are trying to wait for her to gain weight before they transplant.  She's only 14 pounds even though she's a year old.  It's pretty darn cute, in a lot of ways.  She's the size of a 3 or 4 month old, but walking!  When we go out, people tend to think I have a miracle baby--a walking 3 month old.  Well, I do.  Just not in the way they think!<br>
<br>
We should be released the Monday after T-giving, so I'll send you a quick update then.  Thanks for the info on TCH, it's always helpful to hear from another mom how their experience went.<br>
<br>
<br>
All the best,<br>
<br>
PlaneCake<br>
<br>
PS- Here is the link to Diana's 1 year portraits-- I like to show off our talented photographer friend as much as I do our cutie pie.  :)<br>

> Unfortunately, we're getting a little too practiced with Diana being in the hospital.  She has a genetic disorder called Alagille Syndrome.  It affects many body systems, but primarily the liver and heart.  She spent 4 days in the hospital last year right before Christmas for a liver biopsy and exploratory surgery.  then we spent 3 weeks in April for IV antibiotics for a liver infection called cholangitis.<br>

> We've been seen twice already at TCH, but only as outpatients. they've done a full liver transplant evaluation on her, and are trying to wait for her to gain weight before they transplant.  She's only 14 pounds even though she's a year old.  It's pretty darn cute, in a lot of ways.  She's the size of a 3 or 4 month old, but walking!  When we go out, people tend to think I have a miracle baby--a walking 3 month old.  Well, I do.  Just not in the way they think!<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Thanks to everyone for your prayers!  Diana's hospital stay went well.  She now has a feeding tube, and it seems to be helping her gain weight.  We're just hoping to get her as bulky as possible in case she ends up needing to liver transplant.  She's 15 months old, and just hit 16 pounds!  So, she looks like a 5 month old that can walk!  We get a lot of strange looks when we're out and about. :)<br>

Hope you all had a great holiday season and we can't wait to see everyone at the next event.<br>

TCH is an incredible place, so you're going to be in the best hands possible.  Noah's a normal active four-year old boy now, so I know your baby will be fine as well.  Prayers and best wishes.<br>
