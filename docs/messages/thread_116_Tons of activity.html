                    <div class="plaintext-content">It seems like we finally may be getting some more letterboxers in the greater Houston/SE Texas area.  I'm getting more and more found reports, some on boxes that have lain fallow for a long time.<br>
<br>
I'm glad to see the activity.  We may have to plan a little mini meet in the fall so we can put names and faces together.  <br>
<br>
I'm dreading the restart of soccer season.  Now, it looks so doable, but in the fall it'll be all that running around all over again.<br>
<br>
We're heading to CO in a few weeks to pick up mushroom hunter as he's been at a camp there for a month.  And hopefully, we'll be escaping the heat too.<br>
<br>
Anyway, welcome new boxers and old hands, feel free to chime in and say hello.   Any new people who want to introduce themselves, feel free.<br>
<br>
I'll pose an icebreaking question...what was your first letterbox found?<br>
<br>
Ours was baby bear's old houston texans box near the Houstonian.  Found more than 7 years ago.  we had read about letterboxing several years prior and then there weren't any boxes near us.  So I had thought, well, if I ever go to Connecticut, I'll have to remember that.  Then, we were planning a trip to Colorado and I thought, maybe I'll see if there are any boxes there...and it turned out that in the interim, baby bear and silver eagle and a few other friends had been planting here.  That was the start of many great times.<br>

Hi Dewberry! I'm Kristy or Bulldogger and I started letterboxing last month with my mom BAMH Kid... She had started doing it with her Summer Camp Kids and one weekend I was bored so I let her talk me into a trip to Galveston and then after that I was addicted.. :)<br>
<br>
We just spent Saturday and Sunday in Memorial Park and ended up finding close to thirty boxes.  We plan on planting our first series in the area soon.  <br>
<br>
We also had a road trip planned to Orlando in August but now it's going to be filled with tons of letterboxing! <br>

We are senior citizens and letterboxing is a great reason to get out and about.  We heard about letterboxing from my brother-in-law who visited us for Thanksgiving of 2005.  He and his wife stopped in an REI outdoor store on the way and accidentally discovered a book about letterboxing.  After a big turkey dinner we decided to see if there were any boxes nearby and, to our amazement, there was a box by someone called Silver Eagle hidden in the forest about 5 miles from our house.  It was called "Big Creek Bug" and it's still there.  I checked on it a couple of months ago and it hasn't been found in a couple of years. Baby Bear has one there, also, called "Beer Belly Bob", and it was alive at that time also. Anyway, the next day was spent finding letterboxes in and around Huntsville and The Woodlands.  Welcome to the fun.<br>
<br>
A fall event sounds like a great idea, dewberry.  We always enjoy your gatherings.  I ran into Open Space in Glenwood Cemetery the other day (you meet letterboxers in the strangest places) and she mentioned that she would like to host an event in the fall if you didn't have one planned.  Maybe you could collaborate with her.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Similar thing happened to me.  I read about letterboxing in Spring of 2002 but since no boxes were close I forgot about it until Baby Bear and I took a trip to Glacier NP that summer.  I printed out clues to one box in Spokane, the last place we would stay before coming home, and luckily we found it and were hooked.  Once we got home we started hiding boxes for each other and future letterboxers we hoped would follow, and sure enough they did.  Welcome to all newcomers!<br>

I'm so glad to be done with soccer, even though my daughter's school sports still require me to drive a lot since buses aren't used much anymore.  Glad you are enjoying the "soccer" boxes I placed during all those games.  Looking forward to an event in the Fall no matter who hosts it.<br>
