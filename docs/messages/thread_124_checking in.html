<br/>
I know I've been quiet.  With my boys the ages they are, my letterboxing time has been seriously squeezed!  Mother of Five and I were able to get out some on the spring, but many things limited out time available.  Hopefully, we'll get back in the routine in the fall.  In the meantime, I still have a backlog of hundreds of stamps I hope to place.  <br/>
<br/>
Thank you all to everyone who supports letterboxing in the greater Gulf Coast area!  Welcome to our new members.  Don't forget to introduce yourselves and say hi!<br/>
