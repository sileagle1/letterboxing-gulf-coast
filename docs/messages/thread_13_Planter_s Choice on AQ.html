feature--planter's choice.  You can choose your favorite boxes of your<br>
own plants, and give tehm the planter's choice.  <br>
<br>
I've done that for a few of mine--<br>
<br>
Celestial Elemental (time to go find it, someone, it's a good box, I<br>
promise!)<br>
Oscar!<br>
Texas State of Mind<br>
Abita Beer<br>
Lawnmower Lookout<br>
<br>
and I'm going to choose a few others.  However, just because I've<br>
picked it as one of my favorites, doesn't mean it will be one of yours.<br>
<br>
But, picking favorites is hard!  And that made me curious, what is<br>
your favorite box you've planted and what makes it your favorite?<br>

My favorite box I've planted is Letterboxing Fortune Cookie.  I like <br>
the stamp (based on a real fortune cookie I received), the clues <br>
(written in "Chinese"), and the hiding spot (hanging camo bag).  It <br>
turned out really cute...IMOHO.  LOL!<br>

Oscar! because it's just a total package--the whole thing just came<br>
together so well, and when I was planting it there was a surprise that<br>
made it even better.<br>
<br>
Texas State of Mind because I love kitsch.<br>
<br>
Abita Beer because it survived Hurricane Katrina, and the brewery is a<br>
special place for my husband and me--we always eat there whenever<br>
we're heading that way<br>
<br>
Llawnmower Llookout because it shows off one of those weird things<br>
that I love about Houston, how the unexpected and quirky can be found<br>
in what seems like the most normal of places.<br>
<br>
& Celestial Elemental, also because the park is quirky, the carving is<br>
one of my best & I had wanted to do a box clued like that for a long<br>
time, so was happy when I could get it to work.<br>
<br>
Other favorites of mine are Surrender Dorothy!, Landlubbers, the<br>
Saurus Rex and I'm Sari I Tigress and the Alien boxes.  <br>
<br>
You all will be happy to know I'm working on some more puzzle boxes as<br>
I have time--I have a stockpile of ideas. They're not all hard, but<br>
it'll be interesting to see if I can make them work.<br>
