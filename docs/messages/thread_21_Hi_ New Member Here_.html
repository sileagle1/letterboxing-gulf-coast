<div> </div>
<div>I normally lurk on this list, but I saw you mention Lake Livingston SP.  It has some excellent boxes there - I've boxed there twice and enjoyed myself each time.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I especially like the raised walkways, but I realized the second time why they are raised - when it rains heavily, the paths would flood if it weren't for the wooden walks.  Water really stands there!  My sis-in-law, my son, and I went right after big rains and were going to look for Baby Bear's box that used to be hidden under one of the steps.  We gave up poking around with a stick and finally she stuck her hand in to find it (realize - this is NEVER a good idea).  As she was feeling around, I noticed a snake swimming our way, so we decided to leave the box there.  We went instead to a nearby pond and noticed other snakes swimming on the surface.  One began swimming our way (we were on a pier over the water), so she took my walking stick and smacked the water with it.  Rather than scaring him away, it drew him nearer (cats aren't the only curious animals), so she smacked the water again, and still he came.  So she smacked it a third time and hit him in the head, and she yanked it back and as she did I envisioned the snake coiling around the stick and slinging back over our heads as she pulled the stick back.  It didn't - thankfully - and he went underwater, but we decided he might have been going to call out his snake gang, so we moved along. We gave the stick to my son and designated him snake slayer for the rest of the trip.  While it made for a few tense moments, we didn't see another snake for the rest of the trail (and we weren't very far along it when that happened).

<div>I hope you enjoy LLSP as much as we did!</div>
