Daisy & Onslow, the more I'm thinking about it, I think it would be<br>
really fun to plan a mini-meet around a time when you're behind the<br>
taps at St. Arnold's.  <br>
<br>
We could take the tour and then adjoin to a nearby pizza or casual<br>
restaurant afterwards.  Of course, this is something that HAS to wait<br>
until Mother of Five gets back.  If we did a beer event without her, I<br>
couldn't take the heat.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We will be working the taps at Saint Arnold on July 21 but after <br>
that not until September 1 (Labor Day Weekend). Occasionally they <br>
send out a call for extra volunteers and we go down there but that <br>
would be more last minute. <br>
<br>
Went out lb'ing last Friday morning but the dive-bombing mosquitoes <br>
chased me and "Rose" out of the woods. We found one box (SnowDog in <br>
Dyess Park) that didn't require a blood donation. Maybe we'll try <br>
again today. Does anyone have a beekeeping suit I could borrow?<br>
