have for new boxes in 2007?<br>
<br>
I have a couple of semi-series planned:  <br>
the Letterboxing Fools (Carving Fool, Finding Fool & Planting Fool)<br>
Where in the World, wherein I get to play with different sorts of map<br>
clues.<br>
And I always wanted to do a series called The Bayou City (where I<br>
plant one letterbox on each bayou around town), but so far I haven't<br>
gotten up the steam for that one.<br>
I will probably add some boxes to my Stop & Look series that so far<br>
has one box, there's no place like home.  <br>
Probably some more seasonal, limited-time boxes (although I have a<br>
hard time pulling them at the end).<br>
<br>
I have a few other singles in the works, including some stamps that<br>
have been carved for six months (or more!) but I haven't gotten<br>
hidden.  This year, I want to spend more time finding than hiding, but<br>
I am the Carving Fool, so those stamps need to go somewhere.<br>
