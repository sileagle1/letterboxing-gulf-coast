today for our first finds. We had a great time and found two boxes. <br>
Couldn't find the 4 down the trails due to the short legs of my 3 year <br>
old :) Had so much fun stamping. We found "Drip, Drip, Drop" and "Cozy <br>
Campfire"  I am so excited to have found such a fun hobby and it is <br>
something we can all do. Thank you all for putting the time into the <br>
wonderful boxes.<br>
