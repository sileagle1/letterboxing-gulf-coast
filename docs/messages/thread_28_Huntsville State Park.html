there are 6 boxes at Lake Livington and only 1 in Huntsville. I am <br>
going to work on a few of my own to plant there before March but would <br>
love some others from you wonderful people. Please help me out. Thanks.<br>

                    <html><body><div>Huntsville SP is apparently not friendly to letterboxing.  There have been boxes placed there in the past, and they go missing almost immediately.  I learned this as I was researching boxes there last winter, and previous planters seem to think that there maybe park staff is removing them.

<div>If you really want them to letterbox with you, I would suggest that you plant some of your own and give them the clues to find them.  If you want to leave your boxes behind, you can leave them and make them either true WOM or you can require that someone contact you for the clues.

<div>It seems some state parks in Texas are very friendly to stashing games and some aren't.  <br/><br/> </div>
