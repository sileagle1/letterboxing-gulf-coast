                    <div class="plaintext-content">Okay....I joined!!!  Thank goodness since y'all seem to be talking <br/>
about me already!  :)  Let me address a couple of things from the other <br/>
posts:  on keeping hot chocolate hot...how many people do you want to <br/>
serve hot chocolate to?  I have a couple of rather large thermos <br/>
bottles that we have used for Michael's adventure races and they have <br/>
kept soup and hot water hot for over 12 hours in some rather cold <br/>
conditions!  I also have a Coleman stove that I could bring...or do you <br/>
know if the area at Mercer has electric outlets?  We could bring coffee <br/>
makers or hot pots.<br/>
<br/>
Now...for the important stuff...since chocolate is in my trail name, I <br/>
would gladly bring something in that family to share!  I told MO5 that <br/>
I would look for some Italian candy to bring back for the kids.  Not <br/>
promising it will make it home, given the person I married.  I swear, <br/>
he is like a kid! I can also bring something else to share as well!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for inviting me to the group!  <br/>

I have to check on the pavilion, but can't seem to think of it during<br/>
office hours.  We're going to do it that date whether we get the<br/>
pavilion or not--just gather around in the picnic area. <br/>
<br/>
Hot pots of hot chocolate or water (and we'll bring the packets) would<br/>
work really well.<br/>
