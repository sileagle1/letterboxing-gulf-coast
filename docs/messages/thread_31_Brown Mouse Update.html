                    <div class="plaintext-content">We found this one alive and well this morning, although there was some<br/>
water in the box and the inner baggie hadn't been completely sealed,<br/>
the logbook was ok.  <br/>
<br/>
However, the landmarks leading to this box have all changed and there<br/>
isn't even a trail anymore, so none of the clues make a whit of sense.<br/>
 So, I have pulled it, and it is enjoying a life of semi-retirement in<br/>
the back of my car right now, after having survived almost exactly 2<br/>
years out in the wild.  I will try to figure out what to do with it. <br/>
If I don't bring it back, I'll bring back something in that vein.<br/>
<br/>
Thanks to everyone who found it during those two years--it was fun to<br/>
read your notes.<br/>
