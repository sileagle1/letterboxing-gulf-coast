<div>Thank you so much, Dewberry and thanks for tracking me via computer.  
We had text messages sent to our phones every time I crossed a timing mat, so 
four times throughout the race, my family knew how I was doing!!  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>Today was the perfect stay in bed in your pj's kind of day, but when the 
alarm went off at 4:20 ( and I slept right through it) opening your eyes to 4:50 
staring you in the face is a MAJOR wake-up call!  We made it to the GRB 
with plenty of time to spare, so all was good.  The race was really good, 
the weather wasn't too bad, I don't feel too sore right now, I PR'd!! and will 
only end up losing two toenails as battle wounds!</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Currently, I am on my second chocolatey drink from Starbucks and all is 
well in the world! </div>

time thing just to prove to myself I could do it.  The fact that you <br>
continue to run this distance year after year is truly amazing.  My <br>
knees hurt just thinking about it.<br>
