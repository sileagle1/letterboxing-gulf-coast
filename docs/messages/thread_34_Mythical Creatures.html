with the responses I have received today on boxes for this series.  Many 
people have asked me, "I want to do (insert idea here) is that what you had in 
mind?"  So here is my answer...the theme "mythical creatures" is just that, 
a theme.  Any and all variations will be most welcomed (unless they are 
from Baby Bear, then they may or may not need to be censored :) )  Just use 
the theme as a starting point.  (Ready for an annoying phrase?)  
Thinks outside the (letter)box!  Thanks to all who have already offered 
boxes for this series.  Let's make the biggest series in the US!
