<div>Hello all!  I am 
so happy with the responses I have received about the Mythical Creatures 
series!  So far I have 14 boxes pledged...including one from our friends 
the Boxalots!  This promises to be a great project.  If you haven't 
heard back from me, feel free to go ahead and carve the stamp you wrote to me 
about.  I think I have answered everyone, but 4 out of 5 kids are sick 
today, so it is quite possible I missed someone.  The following are the 
names I have on my list, if yours is missing please e mail me off list and let 
me know.  Thanks to everyone who offered to carve (and it's not too late to 
add your box!) this is going to be great fun!</div>

<div>sorry about that caps 
lock problem, I broke my arm at the beginning of typing class in high school, 
and never did learn how to type (shh...don't tell)
