<div>Welcome 
yippikiyo!  Glad to hear that you are joining us...we are in need of some 
fresh boxes around these parts (hint hint!)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>I'm with dewberry...I 
prefer the woods...but since I am already worried that time is short for getting 
out and boxing in the summer heat, I like the short park boxes for the summer 
when all the kids are home.  Maybe we could all place a box near our 
favorite place to swim for a sort of group summer 
series....MO5</div></body></html>

Let us know a bit about your boxing group and the first box you found.<br/>
<br/>
We're a family of four, and we usually box together, although sometimes <br/>
I box solo or with a friend.  When we're together we go by Gramatrick.  <br/>
When I'm alone, I'm dewberry.<br/>
<br/>
Our first box was Houston Texans (now retired) by Baby Bear.  I think <br/>
we're just about on our 3rd anniversary of finding it.  <br/>
<br/>
I had heard of letterboxing ages ago from Family Fun, but when I <br/>
checked the website, there weren't any boxes in this area.  "Well," I <br/>
said to myself, "If we ever get to Connecticut that'll be something to <br/>
try."  And then, 3 years ago, we were planning a trip to Colorado and <br/>
checked to see if there were any on the way.  Shockingly, there was one <br/>
(Houston Texans) within a few miles of our house! We went right out and <br/>
found it...<br/>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">We're not new boxers, having first heard about this great sport on <br/>
Thanksgiving, 2005.  A year and a half experience would make us <br/>
novices in most circles, but in letterboxing in Texas, it makes us <br/>
seasoned veterans.  Since we started, we have accumulated over 600 <br/>
finds, all but 3 in Texas (those 3 were in Italy!).  We are Boots <br/>
Tex and Lone Star Quilter, and we are both in our 60's.  We retired, <br/>
then moved to the piney woods and opened a retreat for quilters, <br/>
which keeps us pretty busy.  LSQ's brother, El Lobo, found a book on <br/>
letterboxing while browsing in an REI store, but he lives in West <br/>
Texas, so had no boxes to find.  When they came to visit us for <br/>
Thanksgiving, he told us about this intriguing hobby, so we decided <br/>
to find a box nearby, and it happened to be Silver Eagle's "Big <br/>
Creek Bug", so that was our first.  We invariably letterbox <br/>
together, so we now use a common stamp most of the time.  We went to <br/>
Challenger 7 Park yesterday and found a very nice box by new <br/>
letterboxers, the Hoppers, called "The Doubtful Guest".  This was a <br/>
good location and a wonderful stamp, and we were very impressed.  We <br/>
can't wait to find more "Hopper" boxes. Welcome, new boxers.<br/>

4Anglers.  I have two children, girl 9 and a boy 6: and one heck of <br/>
a husband.  I luckily have gotten to be a stay at mom for the last <br/>
several years, but the end of that is nearing.  My family enjoys the <br/>
outdoors mostly fishing and camping.(that's were the family trail <br/>
name comes in, mostly saltwater)<br/>

We have been Letterboxing since the beginning of April.  I found out <br/>
about LB though a Girl Scout training and have been hooked ever <br/>
since.  We are from Crosby, but spend a lot time in other parts of <br/>
Texas. (mainly the coast and hill country)  We have found several <br/>
Lbs and just started placing a few.  I really enjoy getting to go to <br/>
other people's favorite places and learning a little history, while <br/>
trying to find a LB.  Anyway, I am really enjoying letterboxing and <br/>
see myself doing it for a long while. <br/>
<br/>
Thanks - Tejas Angel <br/>

<div>Welcome Amy!  I 
love when one of my boxes is a "first box" for someone!  Glad to see 
someone else out there in the mayhem of boxing with little kids (mine are 
11,9,6,4 and 2).  It has its own "rewards".  If you need tips on 
choosing boxes that are "kid friendly" just ask.  You'll find a lot of 
people here and on the Texas list happy to answer any questions.  Mother of 
Five</div>
<div>PS I was so happy to 
get your note after your first "boxing outing".  Keep contacting the placer 
after you find boxes, it is a great way to get to know the boxers in your area.
