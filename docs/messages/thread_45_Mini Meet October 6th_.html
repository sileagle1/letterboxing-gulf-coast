&gt; It's still a go....I'm going to get it posted next<br/>
&gt; week when Mother of Five<br/>
&gt; and I are finally both back in town at the same time<br/>
&gt; and can discuss<br/>
&gt; logistics.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; I am going to see if they are going to do the<br/>
&gt; scarecrows at Mercer again<br/>
&gt; this October and see if I can get a pavilion for<br/>
&gt; that day...if so we are<br/>
&gt; going to have an event titled<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Off to see the Wiz-zard, with an OZ theme.<br/>

&gt; &gt;   I was just checking our calendar for the next<br/>
&gt; couple of months and<br/>
&gt; &gt; was reminded about the Mini Meet for October 6th.<br/>
&gt; I went to AQ and<br/>
&gt; &gt; didn't find it posted. I'm assuming the event is<br/>
&gt; still a go? We're<br/>
&gt; &gt; leaving it on our calendar just in case. I can't<br/>
&gt; wait for cooler<br/>
&gt; &gt; weather. We went out and found a couple of nice<br/>
&gt; boxes this morning,<br/>
&gt; &gt; but it's just too hot this afternoon. The boxes<br/>
&gt; were Pastry<br/>
&gt; &gt; Princess's Muppets Series Gonzo box (great stamp)<br/>
&gt; and Ghost Light of<br/>
&gt; &gt; Bragg Road. The latter is a nice box on an<br/>
&gt; interesting road in<br/>
&gt; &gt; Hardin County, built on the roadbed of an old<br/>
&gt; railroad, with<br/>
&gt; &gt; informational signboards along the way. It's been<br/>
&gt; there since March<br/>
&gt; &gt; and we were first finders. I'm thinking of putting<br/>
&gt; a box out there<br/>
&gt; &gt; just as a little more incentive to visit.<br/>
