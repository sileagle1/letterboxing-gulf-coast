It depends how much boxing people want to do in the heat of a Houston <br>
summer.  I would add a few short-term boxes at Memorial Park and then <br>
host a get together at Texadelphia down the street if there's <br>
interest.  <br>
<br>
Is there interest?  If so, how about June 23rd/June 24th?  If Rice is <br>
still playing in the College World Series (fingers crossed), we'd be <br>
at Texadelphia anyway.  <br>
