It depends how much boxing people want to do in the heat of a Houston <br/>
summer.  I would add a few short-term boxes at Memorial Park and then <br/>
host a get together at Texadelphia down the street if there's <br/>
interest.  <br/>
<br/>
Is there interest?  If so, how about June 23rd/June 24th?  If Rice is <br/>
still playing in the College World Series (fingers crossed), we'd be <br/>
at Texadelphia anyway.  <br/>

a <br/>
