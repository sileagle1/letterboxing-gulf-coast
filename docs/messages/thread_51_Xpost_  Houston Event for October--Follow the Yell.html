Want to sign up for a specific character or box to carve?  There are<br/>
so many cool Oz-related images &amp; ideas...if there's an idea you want<br/>
to claim, do so here and I'll update the AQ page as needed.<br/>

There's not a reservable covered pavilion at Memorial Park, but there<br/>
are plenty of picnic tables--I'll try to figure out an exact location<br/>
a bit closer. And it's centrally located, with lots of existing boxes<br/>
there and nearby, and a fantastic new playground for the little kids.<br/>
 The older kids can feel free to bring soccer balls or frisbees.<br/>
<br/>
This is meant to be casual. Not too many planned activities, but as<br/>
always you should keep alert.  I'm sure at some point I'll get carried<br/>
away (that's my party planning gene kicking in).<br/>
<br/>
Just watch out for mountain bikes on the trails on Saturday!  They're<br/>
playing the role of the flying monkeys.<br/>
