Mother of Five is doing the event stamp, and I'll be carving something<br/>

We will probably have some children's boxes like we did at the Great<br/>
Book Adventure.  Our children's boxes are not limited to children,<br/>
though.  We'll have a unique hiding way for those boxes so that even<br/>
kids who are not readers will be able to find them!  My kids still<br/>
have treasured memories of both the Candyland game and the Kids' Book<br/>
walk from last year...it'll be along those lines!<br/>

We're so glad that Puddlesplasher and her husband will be there.  If<br/>
there are any non-boxing spouses, know that Puddle Splasher's husband<br/>
will be there to hang around &amp; gab with.<br/>
<br/>
We have boxers coming from East Texas (Barefoot Lucy &amp; Blue<br/>
Butterfly), the Metroplex (Puddlesplasher) and Austin (CanCan).  Plus,<br/>
I assume GG is coming, he told me he would, he just doesn't always<br/>
sign up.  <br/>
<br/>
Plans are being made...I think it'll be a fun event for all ages!<br/>

     Looking forward to seeing the Wizard of Oz and all of the <br/>
characters that follow the  Yellow Brick Road. I can't commit to a <br/>
stamp as of yet, but maybe later.<br/>

It sounds like your husband is a boxer but doesn't know it. <br/>
Trips &amp; carving stamps.That's half of it. I'd be willing to bet he's<br/>
even read a couple of clues in his time. lol<br/>
My husband feels the same way. I'm looking forward to seeing a putting<br/>
faces with all the names.<br/>

<br/>
A note to say that Teepman and I are excited to be coming in and are <br/>
very much looking forward to our time galavanting around Texas.  Teeps <br/>
lived in Houston a long, long time ago and hasn't been back since.  It <br/>
will be interesting to see how the city has boomed since the mid 80s.  <br/>
<br/>
We've been printing clues and trying to group them, trying to map <br/>
them - fun feature at AQ, eh? while simultaneously trying to clean <br/>
house and do enough at work that needs to be done so that we can <br/>
leave.  The joys of your own business.  <br/>
<br/>
I think we're even going to squeeze in a day trip to Galveston while <br/>
there.  I don't think I've been there since before the the UFO shaped <br/>
radio station was wiped out by a hurricane.  Heh, my dad and I really <br/>
pulled one over on my two older brothers about spotting a UFO with <br/>
that one.  Just seems like I've been missing out on that part of Texas <br/>
too much!<br/>
<br/>
Thanks for the gathering Dewberry!<br/>
<br/>
Se y'all soon!<br/>
