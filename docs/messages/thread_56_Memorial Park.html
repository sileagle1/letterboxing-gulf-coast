                    <div class="plaintext-content">Today we set out to place the boxes we had carved for the Oz Event in<br/>
October. I think before then, we all need to get together and go to<br/>
Mercer,get some of those hard working spiders, and transplant them at<br/>
Memorial park. The mosquitoes are horrible!!! <br/>
Pack the OFF!!!<br/>
On the upside of the day we ran into some boxers and exchanged with<br/>
Pastry Princess &amp; Tejas Angel.We chatted a short while. They seem like<br/>
 really great gals. They are also brave. They were on a marathon<br/>
boxin' trip without kids, so they were not going to let a little thing<br/>
like mosquitoes slow them down.  <br/>

                    <html><body><div>Thanks for mentioning us Baileys Bunch.  We had a great time finally meeting up with you guys since we always seem to pass trails by a day or two.</div> <div> </div> <div>Our adventure... We 1st set out just to scope out things before the event since Pastry Princess had never been to Memorial Park and Tejas Angel hadn't been in a long while.  We then thought hmmm why not a Memorial Marathon.  Then we thought we could go and get alot done without the kids.  Neither one of us has ever gone boxing without them.  So we inlisted our husbands for kid watch.  LOL</div> <div>As we got to Memorial Loop we were set for our 1st box.  Thank you Dewberry for the kids footwear.  It was a very easy way to start our day.  Then that's when it got hairy.  We headed to the next box.  When we opened the box it smelled really bad and was soaked.  BOO HOO!  But as we were tring to stamp in a hoard of mosquitos began
 their attack.  So we had to hurry hurry hurry.  We just thought that was crazy.  Next we headed to find TK's B-day boxes.  As we began our walk Tejas Angel passed a Garbage Can and Oh my gosh there was a possum in it.  Scared us to death.  While dealing with this issue the MOSQUITOS phoned their friends &amp;said go after the 2 letterboxers they taste yummy.</div> <div>So while going for the next 2 boxes we were attacked so much that our shorts and shirts looked like they had black polk a dots all over them.  So off to Kroger we went to get some Bynadryl cream and more OFF.  We also invested in outdoor FOG!  We weren't going to let a few hundred BLOOD SUCKERS deter us.  This is when our day got way better.  As we went to the ball/rugby field side armed and ready we ran into Bailey Bunch.  Chit chatted and tring not to itch.  They are wonderful.  There were a couple more boxes we attempted but
 couldn't find them.  I THINK IT WAS DUE TO A Low BLOOD COUNT. LOL</div> <div>Then we headed off to the Aborium.  Wonderful place to visit.  We found box of Legos Thanks MO5.  A must on the list.  Then we went to find part 1 of Parting the waters by Baby Bear.  This is where we started felling blood flow again and knew we had to go back to Memorial Park for part 2.  We then decided to find one of dewberry's puzzler clues.  We found it! </div> <div>In all we found 2 HH, left 1 HH, 1 exchange, 2-3 attemps, and found 17 BOXES.  We even stumbled accross a Geo box.  Even though we had no clue what to do with it but we had to be a little curious.  Another 1st find for us.</div> <div>Thanks for the GREAT ADVENTURE!</div> <div>Pastry Princess/ Tejas Angel</div><p>
