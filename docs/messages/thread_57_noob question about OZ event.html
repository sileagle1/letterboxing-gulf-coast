<br>
That's actually a very GOOD question.  If you'd like, you can create <br>
the box and hide it before the event, and post the clues as normal.  <br>
Then folks would have time to print the clues themselves before <br>
coming to the park.  <br>
<br>
OR<br>
<br>
You can create the box and bring it with you to the event.  Then you <br>
sneak out and hide it, hand-write the clues, and post the clues on a <br>
bulletin board that will be set up for just that purpose.  That way <br>
people can copy down the clues at the gathering to go find the box.<br>
<br>

<div><font color="#000080" face="Bookman Old Style" size="2">You can really do as 
you like with your box, events have a place for everything.  Some like to 
sit and chat, and appreciate "table boxes" to stamp as they do so.  Some 
can't wait for the hunt, so boxes hidden ahead of time will be in place for 
them.  Dewberry and I are planning special trails for the kids (of course, 
anyone is invited to find these boxes; but they will be hidden in a "kid 
appealing" sort of way.)  Some people bring boxes to hide in clever ways on 
the gathering tables (Runs for Chocolate hid one in a box of Hershey's kisses, 
dewberry hid some in cereal boxes) so you could do something like that too if 
you can't make it to Memorial Park ahead of time.  We will also have a 
bulletin board to post clues for boxes hidden that morning.</font></div>

<div><font color="#000080" face="Bookman Old Style" size="2">One of the best parts 
of a gathering is meeting all the other boxers, so hanging out at the table is 
encouraged!  There will be plenty of boxes for every style of letterboxer, 
so plant yours the way you see fit.  I am really looking forward to seeing 
old friends and meeting all the new boxers...don't worry, no one here will laugh 
at a question like that.</font></div>

<div><font color="#000080" face="Bookman Old Style" size="2">As for food, this event 
is designed to be low key (did you hear that, dewberry?) so lunch and drinks are 
BYO.  Of course, if you have brewed up a batch of "letterboxer lager" (I 
personally love amber ales...hint hint) you are most welcomed to bring some to 
share :)  -Mother of Five</font></div>

<br/><br/>We're going to do bring your own lunch &amp; drinks to make it easier on the organizers.  There are lots of convenient spots nearby.<br/><br/>It's gonna be so fun!  Just hope for dry weather before hand (and that day), to lessen the mosquito population.  There's no pavilion at Memorial Park, so we'll be exposed to the elements.

the time to do the kid-friendly stuff. My little ones<br>

a kolsch (not fit to serve to friends) that is the<br>
color of pea soup and tastes a bit like composted<br>
grass clippings (WTF happened there?!?) We have an<br>
octoberfest going but not ready to drink. For the<br>
March event I can do a Marzen beer, which might be an<br>
amber ale (I'll check before hand) and would be<br>
appropriate to the season. I was thinking of bringing<br>
a keg of homemade root beer. It would be about 4<br>
gallons, and it has been child tested and approved for<br>
taste. <br>
