                    <div class="plaintext-content">I've spent a few days this week walking the trails and checking on<br>
some of my boxes in advance of the gathering.<br>
<br>
Believe it or not, the mosquitoes weren't bad the last couple of days.<br>
 Of course, I used spray, but they often will dive-bomb in spite of<br>
the spray. They weren't doing that.  Maybe they got their fill last<br>
weekend.<br>
<br>
What was bad was the mud.  It's slip-slidey for sure, so I would<br>
suggest proper footwear.<br>
<br>
My Houston Hills is gone, although I found one lone (sealed) baggie. <br>
I won't replace that probably as I had difficulty keeping that one in<br>
the right spot.  <br>
<br>
Washington State Flower is alive and well...a great stamp from<br>
Campfire Lady.<br>
<br>
I wouldn't think anyone could get to Junie B. Jones right now...I<br>
wouldn't suggest it.<br>
<br>
Surrender Dorothy! and Stop and Look are where they're supposed to be.<br>
 I've gotten reports about most of my other ones.  I still need to<br>
check on the conductor and Landlubbers Beware and one other and do<br>
some routine maintenance.<br>
<br>
I planted one box today, the gatekeeper to the Emerald City.  Of<br>
course, he's near the Green trail!  I've already posted the clues and<br>
it's fine if you want to find him before the gather. Memorial Park has<br>
so many boxes it would be impossible to tackle them in one day.  <br>
<br>
I'll probably send an update in a few days to everyone through the AQ<br>
event page.<br>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">I am glad to hear you are placing yours before the date.  We were <br>
out there all day Sunday and didn't get half of what was out there.  <br>
I am going to try and place one before the meet too.(probably the <br>
Pastry Princess too)  I am also glad we didn't get visited by <br>
Humberto last night.  Some of the bike trails were pretty bad, a <br>
week of dry weather would help alot. <br>
 <br>
Anyway thanks for the updates on all the boxes, good to know!<br>
