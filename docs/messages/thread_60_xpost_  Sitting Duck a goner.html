I've been checking on it every couple of months or so, and this<br>
morning when Mother of Five and I went it was long gone.<br>
<br>
I will be planting one of the OZ boxes there as that trail is too<br>
pretty not to have a box on it.<br>
<br>
I can adopt her boxes on AQ to keep the status up to date (this one<br>
has been retired).  There is nothing I can do with the LBNA listings,<br>
but if you want to check if a particular Hawk box is viable, the AQ<br>
status should be correct (if I've heard about a box).  <br>

We're glad to have her back and I'll no longer maintain her box<br>
status.  You can reach her through AQ.  She is at least reading her AQ<br>
mail now.<br>
