in the negative than in the positive.<br/>
<br/>
What's that?<br/>
<br/>
Think in terms of a simple black and white line drawing of a heart. <br/>
You transfer the image of the heart to the carving material.  If you<br/>
carve in the negative, you carve away the lines, so that your heart<br/>
stamps white while the rest of the image stamps the ink color.  If you<br/>
carve in the positive, you leave the heart and carve away everything<br/>
else, so that the heart stamps the ink color and that's the only<br/>
thing.  Simple negative carving for simple drawings is much easier for<br/>
most people (advanced negative carving is amazing).<br/>

<br/>
I'd stay away from faces in the beginning too.  Think of something<br/>
that you like from one of the stories or the movie (a simple object)<br/>
and start with that--a poppy, a mouse, a broom, the tinman's heart, a<br/>
hot air balloon, a crow, etc.<br/>
