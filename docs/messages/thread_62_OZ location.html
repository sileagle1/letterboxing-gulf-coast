we decided that we will aim to be in the back part of the picnic area<br/>
(generally near the rundown swings and the restroom).  I may or may<br/>
not have time to get some identifier for us (yellow balloons?) as both<br/>
my kids have soccer games that morning (of course).   We want to put<br/>
the pumpkin patch in an area that will keep us AWAY from other people,<br/>
and that seems like a good fit.  <br/>
<br/>
You'll have to drive (or bike) to other areas of the park, but that<br/>
seemed like the best spot for us.<br/>
