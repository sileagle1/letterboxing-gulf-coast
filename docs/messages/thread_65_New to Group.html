<br>
We are new to this email list.  We are Atoy<br>
Adventurers.  We consist of a mom, a LSS and two<br>
little girls.  My trail name is DragonFly Beauty and<br>
my partners in crime are ButterFly Cutie and Pretty<br>
Kitty.  We have recently convinced my LSS to join us. <br>
He has chosen his trailname as Scoring for Jesus.  We<br>
are from East Texas.  We have been letterboxing for<br>
about a year and a half.  We attended our first<br>
gathering in the Houston area last October, the Great<br>
Book Adventure.  <br>
<br>
We are very excited about the Follow the Yellow Brick<br>
Road gathering.  We may even bring Dorothy, the<br>
Tinman, the Scarecrow and the Good Witch with us if<br>
time allows :-)  We will be going to the Houston area<br>
Wednesday night and visiting Galveston for a day and<br>
then back to Houston for a bit of letterboxing before<br>
the event.  Any suggestions of boxes that are must<br>
search fors?<br>
<br>
See you the 6th!!<br>
<br>
Happy Trails!!<br>
<br>
