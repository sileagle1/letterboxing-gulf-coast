</p><div>I had become rather complacent about slamming the car door with my keys inside, knowing I could unzip my back window and crawl in through the back to retrieve them when necessary. Then last spring, we put the hardtop on the jeep when we moved to McKinney. Now that the car keys have chips inside, I can't afford "extra" keys to hide in a magnetized key holder like I used to have ($86 for a spare key? It's cheaper to have a locksmith come out!). Now I won't be able to sleep with the image of my car keys locked inside my car.... thanks a lot MoWizLiz! Hey, looking forward to seeing you again next weekend as well as Teepsman.

                    <div class="plaintext-content">It's probably a good thing you have a hard top now because I can see <br/>
what would happen at the event:<br/>
<br/>
Dewberry would wear her Jeff Probst blue shirt, then line all of us up <br/>
aying:<br/>
<br/>
This is a timed event.  First you have to decipher the message, <br/>
changing all the at to signs, then translating it into French, then <br/>
Greek, and finally a pig latin Flemish, all the while reciting the <br/>
alphabet backwards, giving the sign language letter for each one while <br/>
skipping the vowels as you pass by.  Once you have your clue, race to <br/>
the back of the jeep.  Untie the string that is tied in three Gordian <br/>
knots.  When you have successfully done that, the zipper pull will <br/>
drop.  When that happens, pull the zipper, climb into the back of the <br/>
jeep. Crawl in the back of the jeep, digging through the 100 pounds of <br/>
dirt to find a logbook wrapped in a double zip freezer quart sized <br/>
bag.  The gallon, two gallen and sandwich bags will get you immediately <br/>
disqualified.  You're looking for the quart baggie.  In that baggie <br/>
will be a logbook.  Roll over the passenger front seat head rest, head <br/>
first.  You will now have your feet up in the air.  Use your feet to <br/>
pull down the sunvisor.  A second set of clues will drop.  Decode code <br/>
that one to read the key to solving the one you had before.  You must <br/>
do this with your eyes crossed.  While you are doing that, reach around <br/>
behind you to open the glove box.  In the glovebox is an inkpad.  Use <br/>
the inkpad to ink up that which is at the back of the gearshift.  You <br/>
must reach through and around the steeing wheel to get to that point.<br/>
<br/>
You guys want to know what you're playing for?<br/>
A stamp!<br/>
<br/>
(insert crowd noises of OHHHHHS! and cutaway shots of people smilling <br/>
and nodding)<br/>
<br/>
Dewberry:  Puddlesplasher, you have the unfair advantage of knowing the <br/>
inside and outside of this jeep.  You sit out this round.  Mother of <br/>
Five, you're first up.  Survivor ready!  (shifts the hands up in the <br/>
air while saying) GO!<br/>
<br/>
(Repeat for all contestants)<br/>
<br/>
And all that would just be seriously damaging to your zipper and soft <br/>
top.<br/>
<br/>
===================<br/>
<br/>
Hey, we did get Guido's Hand - mi yesterday.  How is it that we were <br/>
only the second people there since it was planted way back in January??<br/>
