refrigerated, wrap a birthday gift, reconfigure my car seats (and<br/>
clean out junk) to hold 6 kids and head off to pick up said kids for<br/>
OM practice which I am co-coaching today. <br/>
<br/>
So I'm slightly swirly, whirly.....excuse any typos.<br/>
<br/>
I need to change out the container on Surrender Dorothy (raccoons<br/>
chewing again) and I haven't been able to find one that will fit the<br/>
existing contents.  To figure out what to do, I've temporarily removed<br/>
the log (there's a temporary logbook in the box).  Everything should<br/>
be replaced on Friday morning, but I wanted to give a heads-up to<br/>
those of you diligently working on it.  I may end up cutting &amp; pasting<br/>
everyone's sigs into a smaller log book.<br/>
