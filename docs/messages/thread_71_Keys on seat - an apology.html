&gt; It's probably a good thing you have a hard top now because I can <br/>
see <br/>
&gt; what would happen at the event:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Dewberry would wear her Jeff Probst blue shirt, then line all of us <br/>
up <br/>
&gt; aying:<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; This is a timed event.  First you have to decipher the message, <br/>
&gt; changing all the at to signs, then translating it into French, then <br/>
&gt; Greek, and finally a pig latin Flemish, all the while reciting the <br/>
&gt; alphabet backwards, giving the sign language letter for each one <br/>
while <br/>
&gt; skipping the vowels as you pass by.  Once you have your clue, race <br/>
to <br/>
&gt; the back of the jeep.  Untie the string that is tied in three <br/>
Gordian <br/>
&gt; knots.  When you have successfully done that, the zipper pull will <br/>
&gt; drop.  When that happens, pull the zipper, climb into the back of <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; jeep. Crawl in the back of the jeep, digging through the 100 pounds <br/>
of <br/>
&gt; dirt to find a logbook wrapped in a double zip freezer quart sized <br/>
&gt; bag.  The gallon, two gallen and sandwich bags will get you <br/>
immediately <br/>
&gt; disqualified.  You're looking for the quart baggie.  In that baggie <br/>
&gt; will be a logbook.  Roll over the passenger front seat head rest, <br/>
head <br/>
&gt; first.  You will now have your feet up in the air.  Use your feet <br/>
to <br/>
&gt; pull down the sunvisor.  A second set of clues will drop.  Decode <br/>
code <br/>
&gt; that one to read the key to solving the one you had before.  You <br/>
must <br/>
&gt; do this with your eyes crossed.  While you are doing that, reach <br/>
around <br/>
&gt; behind you to open the glove box.  In the glovebox is an inkpad.  <br/>
Use <br/>
&gt; the inkpad to ink up that which is at the back of the gearshift.  <br/>
You <br/>
&gt; must reach through and around the steeing wheel to get to that <br/>
point.<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; You guys want to know what you're playing for?<br/>
&gt; A stamp!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; (insert crowd noises of OHHHHHS! and cutaway shots of people <br/>
smilling <br/>
&gt; and nodding)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; Dewberry:  Puddlesplasher, you have the unfair advantage of knowing <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; inside and outside of this jeep.  You sit out this round.  Mother <br/>
of <br/>
&gt; Five, you're first up.  Survivor ready!  (shifts the hands up in <br/>
the <br/>
&gt; air while saying) GO!<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; (Repeat for all contestants)<br/>
&gt; <br/>
&gt; And all that would just be seriously damaging to your zipper and <br/>
soft <br/>
&gt; top.<br/>

&gt; Hey, we did get Guido's Hand - mi yesterday.  How is it that we <br/>
