Hello everyone!<br/>
<br/>
We are so excited about Follow the Yellow Brick Road<br/>
tomorrow!  We came down Wednesday and have been<br/>
shopping and visiting museums the past couple of days.<br/>
 The girls and Kevin are at the beach at the moment. <br/>
We are contemplating camping out here tonight, but<br/>
then again the Sheraton's hot tub has been calling my<br/>
name all day!!<br/>
<br/>
We stopped by a garage sale in Friendswood today.  It<br/>
was part of a neighborhood wide garage sale off of<br/>
Blackhawk.  They had a ton of store bought stamps.  We<br/>
had just bought some at another garage sale and are<br/>
planning on going to Michael's later tonight to get<br/>
some more pink stuff to carve tonight so my LSS<br/>
frowned upon me getting them but I thought ya'll might<br/>
be interested.<br/>
<br/>
See ya'll in the morning!!<br/>
<br/>
Happy Trails!<br/>
<br/>
Sandy<br/>
mom to Atoy Adventurers<br/>
