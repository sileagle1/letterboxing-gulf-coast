                    <div class="plaintext-content">Hi all!  I have lost the emails for those who said they couldn't find <br>
the Approach box in our Rainy Day series, but I want to let you guys <br>
know we've updated the clues.  Apparently with 46" of rain, some of <br>
the smaller trails have completely grown over this year!  It took us <br>
more than an hour to find the box. So, it's still in the same place, <br>
but new clues are in place to find it.  The hike isn't as adventurous <br>
now, so we apologize for that, but most of the hike for the series is <br>
now stroller friendly.<br>
