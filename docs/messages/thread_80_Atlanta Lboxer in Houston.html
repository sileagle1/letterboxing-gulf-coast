<div>We can't meet up this 
week, there is a bug going through our house.  However, if you want a lot 
of boxes from many different placers all in one location, I would suggest 
Memorial Park and the Arboretum.  Lots of the boxes there are from the OZ 
gathering we had in October, and there are some other oldies but goodies mixed 
in as well.  If you need help searching through names of boxes, let us 
know. -Mother of Five</div>

&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; up for an exchange. I am here in Houston on business with some<br/>
time<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; to kill. I also am looking for any advice on boxes not to miss. I<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; will be here through Thursday afternoon.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt; Thanks for any help you can give me.<br/>
&gt; &gt; &gt; &gt;<br/>
