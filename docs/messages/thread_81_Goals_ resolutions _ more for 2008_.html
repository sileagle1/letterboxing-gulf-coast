<br>
Who sets letterboxing goals or resolutions related to letterboxing?<br>
<br>
I don't really. We're more let-see-what-comes kind of letterboxers.  I<br>
admire people who set goals and stick to them.<br>
<br>
But, as always, I'd like to visit some state parks I've never seen and<br>
find boxes in counties/states I haven't been to.  I'd love to<br>
letterbox in West Texas.  And we're planning a summer vacation to<br>
Colorado, so that offers great possibilities too.<br>
<br>
And I'll continue to plant, but my goal is to make each plant as<br>
meaningful as I can.  <br>
<br>
And I may host another gulf coast gathering mini-gather or two.  We've<br>
got lots of new faces around here and we won't all be able to make<br>
TALE in March (the only way I can come is late on Saturday).<br>

<div>I do.  I like to find a box on 1/1, just to start things off well.  Only, I might not this year.  It was a stunningly gorgeous 50 degrees and clear yesterday.  Today, well, its spit snowing.  Still, I might go plant one to maybe start the year off on that focus.</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Every year, my resolution is boxing in 2 new states.  State of confusion is a constant for me.<br/><br/>This year, I'm bumping up Letterboxing Goals with these 4:</div>
<div>1)  Letterbox in 1 new state in the first three months (that postal ring will see this again)<br/>2)  meet 5 letterboxers I haven't met yet (should be easy since there are new people to the Winter BBQ)<br/>3)  Start planting, planting, planting.  Last year, many people donated stamps that I intended to plant, but we got a heat wave, then real life wiped out June - September... you know how it goes.  But I would like to start knocking out some of these boxes on thoughtful, good trails, longer hikes and well suited areas.  On 12/31, we headed out to SW Indiana and ended up placing one of those donated stamps which is a paddlewheel.  The placement is high on a bluff overlooking the Ohio River and the area where the gent who built the Robert E Lee was born.  Yes, its a driveby and someone else's stamp, but the location is very much out of the way and appropriate. </div>
<div>4)  Vary my clues more.  Instead of those kind that take you directly to the box and point at it, (turn left here, go to the only fir tree, turn right, pick up stone), I'm looking at more coding or just more variety of style.<br/><br/>MoWizLiz</div>

                    <div class="plaintext-content">Since I like to spread my boxes out as much as possible, I usually <br>
try to place boxes in at least 3 new states each year.  However, <br>
since I already have boxes in 35 states, that goal is getting hard to <br>
achieve, so I think I will just try to place boxes in at least 5 new <br>
TX counties this year.  Since TX is so big, this may actually require <br>
more driving :)<br>
