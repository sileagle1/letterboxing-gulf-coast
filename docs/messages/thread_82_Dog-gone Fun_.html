day of pawsitively dog-themed fun at Double Lake in lovely Coldspring,<br>
TX. (insert groan here).<br>
<br>
BT & LSQ have done a great job seeding the area, and believe me when I<br>
say that Double Lake is gorgeous!  It's hard to believe that it is<br>
just an hour from my house.<br>
<br>
Here's the event info:<br>
<br>
http://www.atlasquest.com/events/event.html?gEventId=585<br>
<br>
If you can attend just one event, I hope you'll pick TALE in Bastrop,<br>
TX--the big Texas event.  But, if you're free on the 30th of March,<br>
we'd love to have you join us under the dogwoods at Double Lake for a<br>
relaxing spring picnic (with dog-themed stamps hidden nearby).  <br>
<br>
More details to follow....<br>
