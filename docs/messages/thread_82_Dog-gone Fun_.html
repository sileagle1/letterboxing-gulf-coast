day of pawsitively dog-themed fun at Double Lake in lovely Coldspring,<br/>
TX. (insert groan here).<br/>
<br/>
BT &amp; LSQ have done a great job seeding the area, and believe me when I<br/>
say that Double Lake is gorgeous!  It's hard to believe that it is<br/>
just an hour from my house.<br/>
<br/>
Here's the event info:<br/>

http://www.atlasquest.com/events/event.html?gEventId=585<br/>
<br/>
If you can attend just one event, I hope you'll pick TALE in Bastrop,<br/>
TX--the big Texas event.  But, if you're free on the 30th of March,<br/>
we'd love to have you join us under the dogwoods at Double Lake for a<br/>
relaxing spring picnic (with dog-themed stamps hidden nearby).  <br/>
<br/>
More details to follow....<br/>
