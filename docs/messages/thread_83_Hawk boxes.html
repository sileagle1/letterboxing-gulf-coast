I hope The Fool is there, I wouldn't want to be the only one.  Just <br/>
kidding.  We wanted to go to 11th St. Park to get the Box of the <br/>
Month and were just looking for other boxes along the way, and Hawk <br/>
seems to have a lot still listed, although they appear to be kind of <br/>
strung out in various neighborhood parks that we are not familiar <br/>
with.  We've pretty much got all the boxes in Memorial Park and <br/>
Mercer Arboretum and don't know of any other concentration of <br/>
boxes.  We probably won't have a whole lot of time.  By the way, <br/>
Lucy, thanks for the "dog" comments on the Texas board.  There are <br/>
some possible "dog" letterboxes there that might fit the theme of <br/>
our "Dog Days at Double Lake" minigathering.<br/>
