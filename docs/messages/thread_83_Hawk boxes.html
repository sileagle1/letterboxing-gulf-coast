I hope The Fool is there, I wouldn't want to be the only one.  Just <br>
kidding.  We wanted to go to 11th St. Park to get the Box of the <br>
Month and were just looking for other boxes along the way, and Hawk <br>
seems to have a lot still listed, although they appear to be kind of <br>
strung out in various neighborhood parks that we are not familiar <br>
with.  We've pretty much got all the boxes in Memorial Park and <br>
Mercer Arboretum and don't know of any other concentration of <br>
boxes.  We probably won't have a whole lot of time.  By the way, <br>
Lucy, thanks for the "dog" comments on the Texas board.  There are <br>
some possible "dog" letterboxes there that might fit the theme of <br>
our "Dog Days at Double Lake" minigathering.<br>
