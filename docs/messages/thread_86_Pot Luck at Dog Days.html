<br>
We are all excited about the Dog Days event this weekend...well I <br>
should say 3/4 of us are.  My husband or should I say LSS is off this <br>
weekend and I am bribing him to tag along with us with the promise of <br>
visiting a few sport card shops along the way.<br>
<br>
We can bring the relish, mustard and ketchup for the hot dogs.  <br>
Butterfly Cutie made some peanut butter paw print cookies in honor of <br>
the occassion and I made a carrot cake. <br>
<br>
Is anyone else camping out?  I have good intentions, Butterfly Cutie <br>
and Pretty Kitty have even loaded up the van with camping gear and I <br>
stuck some charcoal in there for the grill and smores makings but I <br>
think I'll be outvoted by the LSS, seems he has an aversion to having <br>
to pack up the tent in the middle of the night if we should happen to <br>
get a bit of that rain early.  I guess I can't win them all!<br>
<br>
See ya'll Sunday!<br>

<br/>One stop that anyone might want to make is Johnsons' Rock Shop in Livingston.  It has to be seen to be believed.<br/><br/>dewberry<br/><br/></p><div class="gmail_quote">On Sat, Mar 29, 2008 at 3:01 AM, Sandy &lt;<a href="mailto:sandyreddingusa@yahoo.com">sandyreddingusa@yahoo.com</a>&gt; wrote:<br/>
