trail was a stress release for us, very relaxing, and all those boxes <br>
were so beautiful.  You're right, we couldn't just get one, we had to <br>
get them all.  Thanks for all you do for letterboxing, dewberry.  If <br>
anyone ever needs  for us to check on a box for you, just let us <br>
know.  By the way, we moved LSQ's "The Hound's Tree" box.  It was <br>
right across from the big picnic area and we moved it to a more <br>
remote spot, so reprint the clues if you come up this way.  All of <br>
you know where we live now, so if you're back in this area, you're <br>
always welcome at the Red Barn.<br>

crash your party. I can't begin to tell you what a treat it is to <br>
hike in those beautiful woods and share the comaraderie with such <br>
wonderful letterboxers. The boxes hidden around the lake were <br>
amazing. It was just a wonderful, wonderful event and we had such a <br>
good time. After the day was done, Viewfinder and I drove around to <br>
the other side of the lake and enjoyed a wonderful walk around the <br>
lake. It was a perfect ending to a wonderful event. THANK YOU, <br>
Dewberry, LSQ, and Boots, and also everyone who came. Puddle Splasher<br>
