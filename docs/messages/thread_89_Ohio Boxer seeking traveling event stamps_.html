I am hosting the first ever event in Ohio's SE corner.  You can sign up <br/>
on AQ if you happen to be in this area on 8/30/08.<br/>
<br/>
If you can't come and would like to be a part of the fun, you can <br/>
always dig in those boxing items to find a stamp you would be willing <br/>
to share here in OH.  <br/>
<br/>
I am accepting stamps that are traveling event stamps or stamps that <br/>
will be hidden for the event and then planted here after the event, <br/>
with you of course, listed as the carver.<br/>
<br/>
If you are willing to consider this, please e-mail me off list at <br/>
grannybutterfly06@yahoo.com.<br/>
<br/>
Thank you for sharing your work with those of us in the North.<br/>

Beautiful Ohio's Edge Event 8/30/2008.<br/>
