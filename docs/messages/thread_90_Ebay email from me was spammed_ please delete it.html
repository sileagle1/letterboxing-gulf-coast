I did not send it, I suspect it came through my phone as it has access to my yahoo mail. I am so sorry about this, if it happens again I will delete this email address and start fresh. Also, it deleted my address book, so if this is not your most current email, please reply back through your favored address. I hope that email doesn't "infect" any of ya'll, my first clue that something was wrong was that I started getting daemon failure notices. Again, I apologize if this causes you any trouble. </div>
