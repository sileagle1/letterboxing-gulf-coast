doesn't mean we can't chat if we're feeling up to it!<br/>

there are many, if any, close to where you live, so you might have to <br/>
travel a bit to find them.  Houston isn't too far and there are a lot <br/>
of good letterboxes there.  You might want to plan a day trip just to <br/>
get started.  Letterboxing is a great family activity.<br/>
