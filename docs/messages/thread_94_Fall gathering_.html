                    <div class="plaintext-content">I have to check the soccer schedules.  We've joined a club for both boys so I'll try to pick a weekend with no tournaments and when you can come (bc it's not the same without you).  The regular games, not the tournaments, are on Sundays now, but one weekend missing reg. games is not a big deal, if we want to do a Sunday instead of Saturday.<br>
<br>
If other people want to weigh in that would be great.  <br>
<br>
I've done a horrid job promoting this list, but we do seem to have new finders in the area.  Like you, when I respond to the find notices, I can't really get a dialog going.  <br>
<br>
But I'd love some new boxes for Mother of Five and me to find once school starts, so I'd like to try and continue to encourage the newer folks and maybe a gathering is a good way to do that.  I just am personally uncomfortable at the really really big ones, so I'd like to keep it low-key and easy.<br>

<p>I have to check the soccer schedules. We've joined a club for both boys so 
  I'll try to pick a weekend with no tournaments and when you can come (bc it's

  boxes for Mother of Five and me to find once school starts, so I'd like to try 
  and continue to encourage the newer folks and maybe a gathering is a good way

We might even get IRA Boxer to plant one, perhaps in a cemetery.  He's been carrying one around for well over a year, called The Music Box and has never found an appropriate place for it. <br>

<div>Okay, why don't we tentatively say the weekend of November 14/15 (exactly 
  which date tbd a little later)? There are no tournaments scheduled for that 
  weekend and I'm ignoring the fact that school is starting with all of its 
  craziness).<br/><br/>I don't want to post an event on AQ too early, because I'd 
  like the size to be manageable and not get way out of hand. I have found the 
  really large ones just too emotionally taxing. The one we had at Double Lake 
  was just about perfect. And the candyland at Mercer was just about my all-time 
  favorite.<br/><br/>Maybe we can get some of the new people involved in the 
  process/planning?<br/><br/>Any themes appealing? <br/><br/>--- In <a href="mailto:gulfcoastletterboxers%40yahoogroups.com">gulfcoastletterboxe<wbr>rs@yahoogroups.<wbr>com</wbr></wbr></a>,

  have to check the soccer schedules. We've joined a club for both boys so I'll 
  try to pick a weekend with no tournaments and when you can come (bc it's not 
  the same without you). The regular games, not the tournaments, are on Sundays 
  now, but one weekend missing reg. games is not a big deal, if we want to do a 
  Sunday instead of Saturday.<br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; If other people want to weigh in 
  that would be great. <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; I've done a horrid job promoting this 
  list, but we do seem to have new finders in the area. Like you, when I respond 
  to the find notices, I can't really get a dialog going. <br/>&gt; <br/>&gt; But 
  I'd love some new boxes for Mother of Five and me to find once school starts, 
  so I'd like to try and continue to encourage the newer folks and maybe a 
  gathering is a good way to do that. I just am personally uncomfortable at the 
  really really big ones, so I'd like to keep it low-key and easy.<br/>&gt;

  &gt; We love to come to your gatherings! I think the only motivation needed is 
  to have your name on it. Unfortunately, our weekends our sometimes booked in 
  advance, so the only two we have open in that time period is October 31 and 
  November 14. I'm not saying you should plan it on one of those dates just for 
  us, but wanted you to know that the only reason we wouldn't come is if we were 
  tied up with a retreat group at our place. Go for it! I have noticed a few new 
  boxer names around town, but haven't gotten much response from them when 
  answering their find notices.<br/>&gt; &gt; <br/>&gt; &gt; Boots Tex and Lone

<br/>I was thinking the other day that we needed a local gathering.   But not until the weather cools off!   I've been in a complete letterboxing funk because of the heat.  This could be the motivation I need to start carving and getting boxes ready to plant once things cool off.<br/>

November 14/15 is good for me.  SoccerChik is leaving for Nac in a few weeks, so other than work my time is pretty much my own.  :)<br/>

Okay, why don't we tentatively say the weekend of November 14/15 (exactly which date tbd a little later)?
