<br>
I really, really love the board game/game theme.  Harvest is cool too, but the board game is up my alley.  In fact, the funny thing is that I was about to suggest it myself when Mo5 did.  So, I second it.  It allows for some interesting interpretations and a wide variety of boxes--which is always fun.  <br>
<br>
So we have a date idea, and a possible theme, we just lack location.  Too bad there's no great new park with a pavilion and virgin trails.  <br>
<br>
We haven't ever done anything at Lake Houston park, so that might be a possibility.  But I can't remember if there's a good gathering area.<br>
<br>
If someone who is a more regular poster on the Texas list wants to write a post steering those interested in helping plan to the discussion here that would be swell.  <br>

We have a baby due the first week of Oct, so we'll have to wait and see how that's going before we commit!

Thanks for setting this up!  We also have some new LBers that we have told and are excited about coming.<br>

Thanks<br>
