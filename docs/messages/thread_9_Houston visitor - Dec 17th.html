<br>
So glad to see you could join the party. . .please feel free to jump<br>
right in.<br>
<br>
I'd love to meet up, but need to be put down as a ?????  Just let me<br>
know, off list, what your plans are and I'll see if I can swing<br>
it--particularly if you're going to be near Mercer, as I need to hide<br>
some boxes!<br>
<br>
But, my littlest is having his tonsils/adenoids out a few days before,<br>
so will have to see how he's doing.<br>
<br>
Thanks!<br>

has been  ornery so I'm a little late posting here.  Sunday the 17th <br>
(Dec) looks good for us and Sandibox too I think.  Anywhere in or <br>
near Mercer is fine as well.  We did the boxes there a few years ago <br>
but would love to do the new ones...<br>
